# Terraforming

Using the shovel icon in the top left (unavailable until repairing a certain building) allows you to terraform your chonk as you will.
You can raise/lower tiles, change the terrain type, and pick up and rotate props.

## Help

Sometimes terraforming actions can be blocked for unclear reasons.
Here are a few circumstances and how to resolve them.

#### Cannot raise/lower terrain

You cannot raise/lower terrain while there is a prop or object on it. Some props may not be easily visible such as dig spots and butterfly spawners.
If you have the 'move object' icon available, you can use that to move the object out of the way, or use the trash icon to send it to your inventory.
Dig spots cannot be moved or trashed, so if both options are unavailable you may need to walk over to the spot and dig it.

#### Cannot trash tree/shrub

While harvestable items can be moved at any time, they can only be 'trashed' into your inventory when they are in their harvested state.
Chopping trees will leave a stump, mining rocks will leave pebbles, and gathering from shrubs and trees will remove the fruit.
Once these actions have been done on a harvestable prop, you can trash it to your inventory.

Sending a prop to your inventory is a much faster way to move lots of props around, as you can pick up many of them then place them repeatedly from your inventory with the crafting action.
