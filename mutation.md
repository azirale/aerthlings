# Mutation Points

## Shared Pool Per Character

Mutation points are shared across all your digital copies of the same Aerthling character.

That means if you see that you have 2 mutation points on a Rockflock, then all your Rockflock copies can see the same 2 points.
Once the points are spent on any Rockflock, it is spent for all of them.

This pooling of mutation points across all copies of a character ties into the buying and trading mechanics.
If you want to spend mutation points on a favourite copy of a character, you are not reliant on getting lineage points on that copy specifically.
You can earn mutation points on other copies of the character, and spend them on  your favourite.

## Earning Mutation Points

### New Lineage

Scanning in a fig for the first time creates a new lineage.
You always get 2 mutation points for a character when scanning in a fig for the first time and starting a new lineage.

### Existing Lineage

Character copies you have can earn lineage points from other copies of the same fig later in the lineage.
Once a character copy has earned enough lineage points, its lineage will level up, and you will gain a mutation point.

You can only earn lineage points from copies *after* yours in the lineage, so it is always helpful to trade away figs so that you can earn lineage points.

#### Trade Away

Each time a fig is traded away, every copy already in the lineage earns lineage points, including the copy for the person currently trading away the fig.
Every time you trade a fig, you are earning lineage points not just for yourself but also for everyone before you in the lineage.

#### Leveling

When a character copy levels up, it earns a small amount of lineage points for every other copy *earlier* in its lineage.
When you level up a character copy, it earns lineage points for all the people that had that fig before you.
For you to earn lineage points this way, you need to trade away the fig to someone else, and have people later in the lineage gain levels with the copies they hatch.
