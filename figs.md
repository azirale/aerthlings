# Figs

Known as "FIGS" officialy, and sometimes referred to as "cubes" for obvious reasons, are the physical collectible toy portion of Aerthlings.
They are sold in individual 'mystery boxes' that contain a fig from a particular series depicted on the box, as well as a short lanyard to keep the fig on and a collector's guide for the series.

## Series

### Seed Series

The seed series is a set of 4 unique figs that cannot be purchased, but instead are given out at events.
You can only ever start a lineage with one seed series fig, if you are looking to acquire more you must trade for them.*


\* During the initial release at PAX Aus 2025 the limit was temporarily increased to 4, to help with initial adoption and trading.

### Genesis Series

The Genesis Series was the first full series available to purchase during initial launch at PAX Aus 2025. It has 24 unique figs in total, with 12 commons, 6 rares, 4 epics, and 2 legendaries.
