# Crafting

You can craft food, which heals for more and can even grant experience.

You can craft shelters and homes for Aerthlings to expand your settlement.

You can craft props to place in the world, including harvestable props to expand your farming.

You can craft multiple of an item at once.
When you do, you can place all of them in the world before going back to the crafting menu.
Actually, you *have* to place them all, so make sure you don't craft far too many at once.

All crafted props can be picked up again using the terraform tool.

## Learning Recipes

You learn recipes to craft items by crafting the item for a quest.
Initially you won't know how to craft most items.
Quests from your resident Aerthlings asking you to craft an item will temporarily give you the recipe for that item.
If you complete that quest, you permanently gain the recipe for the item.

## Help

### Cannot find recipe in crafting menu

Certain items cannot be normally be crafted from the usual crafting menu out in the world, and instead need to be made at a crafting bench or building.

Sometimes you can make them from the normal crafting menu when they are shown as part of a quest, but you will need to be 'near' the appropriate building.

Subsequent crafting of the item needs to be done by interacting with the appropriate crafting prop.
Check these props from time to time to see if there are new recipes in there you may have forgotten that you learned.
